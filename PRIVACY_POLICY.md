# Privacy Policy for PhantomTouch

**Last Updated:** June 1, 2025
**Effective Date:** June 1, 2025

Thank you for using **PhantomTouch** ("the App"), developed by Paul Hoareau ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our macOS application.

Your privacy is critically important to us. **PhantomTouch** is designed with privacy as a core principle.

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect

**PhantomTouch** is designed to function without collecting, storing, or transmitting your personal information. Specifically:

* **No Video Recording or Storage:** The App uses your Mac's camera to perform real-time hand pose estimation and gesture recognition. However, no video feed is recorded, stored on your device, or transmitted off your device by the App. The camera input is processed live and ephemerally.
* **No Personal Identifiable Information (PII):** We do not collect, request, or store any PII such as your name, email address, physical address, phone number, location, or other contact details through the App.
* **No User Accounts:** The App does not require you to create an account to use its features.
* **No Tracking or Analytics (Developer Collected):** We do not implement any third-party or proprietary analytics tools within the App to track your usage patterns or collect device information for our own analysis. Any analytics data, if available to us, would be through Apple's standard App Store Connect analytics, which provides aggregated and anonymized data if you have opted into sharing such data with developers through your Apple account settings.

## 2. Information Processed Locally

To provide its functionality, **PhantomTouch** processes the following information strictly on your local device:

* **Camera Video Stream:** The App accesses your Mac's camera feed in real-time. This video stream is processed locally and immediately to detect hand landmarks.
* **Hand Landmark Data:** From the camera stream, the App derives hand landmark data (the positions of key points on your hand). This data is used in real-time to recognize gestures.
* **Recognized Gestures:** The interpreted gestures are used to control actions on your Mac as configured within the App.

All of this processing occurs exclusively on your device. This data is not transmitted to us or any third party, nor is it stored after processing, except for any temporary data held in memory during active use for immediate functionality.

## 3. How We Use Information (Processed Locally)

The information processed locally (camera stream, landmark data, recognized gestures) is used solely for the following purposes:

* To enable the core functionality of the App: controlling your Mac using hand gestures.
* To perform real-time hand pose estimation and gesture recognition.

## 4. Data Storage

As stated above, **PhantomTouch** does not store any video data or derived hand landmark data after it has been processed in real-time.

Any settings or preferences you configure within the App (e.g., custom gesture assignments, if this feature exists) are stored locally on your device within the App's sandboxed container and are not accessible to us.

## 5. Data Sharing and Third Parties

We do not share any personal data with third parties because we do not collect any.

The App utilizes built-in macOS frameworks for camera access and may use third-party libraries (such as Mediapipe, ONNX Runtime, or similar, as part of its core technology) for hand pose estimation and gesture recognition. These libraries, as integrated into **PhantomTouch**, are used for local processing on your device and are not configured by us to collect or transmit your data.

## 6. Your Control and Choices

* **Camera Access:** You can control the App's access to your camera at any time through your Mac's System Settings (System Settings > Privacy & Security > Camera). If you disable camera access, the App will not be able to perform its core functions.
* **Uninstalling the App:** You can uninstall **PhantomTouch** at any time by dragging the application to the Trash. This will remove the App and any locally stored settings associated with it.

## 7. Security

We take reasonable precautions to protect the information processed by the App. Since all sensitive processing (camera feed) is done locally and no video or personal data is stored or transmitted by the App, the primary security focus is on the integrity of the application itself, which is subject to Apple's App Store review and macOS security features like Gatekeeper and the App Sandbox.

## 8. Children's Privacy

**PhantomTouch** is not directed to individuals under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy and, if the changes are significant, we may provide a more prominent notice (such as adding a statement to our website or within the App Store description). We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about our information practices. Your continued use of the App after any changes to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such changes.
